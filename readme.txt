== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Where to upload my image?**  
add/edit/delete images in this XMl file. "gallery/widget.xml"

**Why my image gallery out of range?**  
In front end widget area, if you see gallery out of area or invisible, it because of height and width of the widget, so you should arrange width and height of the widget in widget configuration area. In default I have fixed width: 200px and height: 155px.  
  
**Why my slideshow not scroll properly or why one image overlaps another at the time of scroll?**  
Set the width and height to the width/height of the LARGEST image in your slideshow!
